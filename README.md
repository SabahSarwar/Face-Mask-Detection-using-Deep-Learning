# Face-Mask-Detetction-using-Deep-Learning

Introduction
The CDC continues to monitor the spread of COVID-19 and advises people who are completely vaccinated as well as those who are not fully vaccinated to wear face masks. When visiting the doctor's office, hospitals, or long-term care institutions, the CDC recommends wearing masks and keeping a safe distance. 

Manually monitoring people entering such institutions is tedious and requires workforce. In this tutorial, we will learn how we can automate this process through deep learning techniques which will automatically detect people not wearing masks to prevent their entry.

Glossary
Deep Learning: It is a kind of machine learning technique that enables learning through the use of neural networks that mimic the human brain.

Prerequisites
1. Programming knowledge in Python.
2. Basic knowledge of Jupyter Notebook, Deep Learning, Keras.
3. Creating the mask detection deep learning model
4. We will now look into building a Deep Learning model to predict (detect) if a person is violating the rules by not wearing a mask in public spaces.
